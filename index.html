                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                
                <p>My name is Benjamin Noland. I'm a recent graduate (May, 2016) of Rutgers University-New Brunswick, where I majored in mathematics and minored in physics. I currently live in Princeton, New Jersey. Here's a picture of me:</p>
                
                <a id="self-image" class="centered-block" href="img/self.jpeg">
                    <img src="img/self.jpeg" alt="Me">
                </a>
                
                <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
                
                <p>I'll be going back to Rutgers in the fall to begin a master's degree in statistics. What I'll do after that is yet to be determined.</p>

                <p>If you think you have suitable part time work for me (over the summer), feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
                
                <p>You can also take a glance at my <a href="https://github.com/bnoland">GitHub page</a> and my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-noland-735217118">LinkedIn profile</a>. A copy of my current resume (in PDF format) is available <a href="https://github.com/bnoland/resume/raw/master/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>What's up with this website?</h2>
                
                <p>It's still very much under construction. There isn't much here right now, and the CSS is still a little crude. I'm sorry about that. But at some point you'll be happy to spend time staring at it. I promise.</p>
