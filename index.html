        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Benjamin Noland. I recently graduated from
        Rutgers University-New Brunswick with an MS degree in
        statistics. I did my undergraduate work at this same
        institution, graduating in May of 2016 with a BA in math and a
        minor in physics. I currently live in Princeton, New
        Jersey.</p>

        <p>Feel free to take a glance at
        my <a href="https://github.com/bnoland">GitHub page</a> and
        my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-noland-735217118">LinkedIn
        profile</a>. A copy of my current resume (in PDF format) is
        available <a href="https://github.com/bnoland/resume/raw/master/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to get in contact with me about research and/or
        work opportunities, my contact information can be
        found <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>What's up with this website?</h2>
        
        <p>It's still very much under construction. There isn't much
        here right now, and the CSS is still a little crude. I'm sorry
        about that. But at some point you'll be happy to spend time
        staring at it. I promise.</p>
